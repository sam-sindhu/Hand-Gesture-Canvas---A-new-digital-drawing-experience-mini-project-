# Hand-Gesture-Canvas---A-new-digital-drawing-experience-mini-project-

Hand Gesture Canvas is an interactive application that enables users to draw on a virtual canvas using hand gestures, eliminating the need for physical input devices like a mouse or stylus. The project leverages OpenCV, MediaPipe, and NumPy to implement real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition.
